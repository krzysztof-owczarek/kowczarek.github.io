## Alias-like functionality in subshells / external subshells (ex. Docker, K8s, etc.)

**Aliases** or bash functions are usually used for repetive commands, that are far too long or complicated to type in every time we need them.

They work perfectly well in our **local terminals**, but are not very useful for the **(external) subshells**, which are quite popular in the contenerized environment and various services in the cloud.

Recently, I have tried to find a solution of not being able to use aliases remotely and save myself the trouble of copy-pasting long commands from the text file over and over again or worse. Type them in every time I need to ðŸ˜¨

### The solution and the big disadvantage - Warp Terminal

Some of you probably know **Warp Terminal** already, as it is available on the market for a noticable period of time now.

It is advertised as a next-gen terminal and they kind of deliver their promisses, compared to the well known, classic terminals like iTerm, at least at their vanilla flavoured form.

... those of you, who already know Warp, probably also know what the big disadvantage is,

... for those of you who have never checked it out, here is a very quick one-liner summary to save you the trouble: 


ðŸŸ¥ **Warp Terminal requires you to log in to use it.** ðŸŸ¥


```
A terminal. Requires. Logging in.

Nobody likes it, but they keep doing it - why?

Counting active users? Maybe stealing secrets? There are multiple opinions on that matter.
```

### ... nevertheless. For those of you, who had not stopped reading the article yet...

Among all features that Warp Terminal offers, there is one called [*workloads*](https://docs.warp.dev/features/warp-drive/workflows).

Long story short, you can define special sets of commands in `.yaml` files, stored locally in a special directory.

Workflows are easily searchable and quickly accessible through the terminal.

### ... but if the definitions of those workloads are stored locally, how is it different from having aliases defined in my local `.rc` file?

Warp Terminal allows you to [*warpify*](https://docs.warp.dev/features/subshells#how-to-warpify-the-subshell) any bash subshell that has been opened in their terminal.

and some *warpifying*...

### Quick search and workflow execution

Right now you can easily use any of the built-in workloads, as well as the ones you create yourself.

You can open a quick search box for workflows by a keyboard shortcut (`shift+control+r` on mac) and find anything you need very quickly.

Workloads on the screenshot are default workloads available in the Warp Terminal.

### Important disclaimer

I am not connected to the company behind Warp Terminal in any way - it just happens to be a tool with a potential solution to the problem.

Given Warp Terminal log in [policy](https://docs.warp.dev/getting-started/privacy) - you have to make the decision about using it yourself.
